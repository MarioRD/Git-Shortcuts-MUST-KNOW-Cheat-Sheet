git mv index.html file.html # rename index.html to file.html
git mv index.html ./src # move index.html to ./src/index.html

+ git branch <new-branch> Ss # create a new branch with all the contents of working directory

git branch <new-branch> v1.2 # create a new branch from a tag

git checkout <tag> # checkout a specific tag

```

------------
I don't feel like adding much to this at it is self-explicative.
Also beware I never post stuff/use social platforms but for some reason I find this resource to be SO helpful to many newcomers,
whish I'd foudn it at the beginning, hence you're welcome ðŸ˜Š!
